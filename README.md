## Description

This progressive web application allows the user to log budget deposits and expenses either with or without an internet connection.

While connected, the user data is stored within a MongoDB database and includes the name of the transaction, the amount and the date and time.  

If the user loses connection or is out of internet service, the app will store the data within an IndexedDB database.  When the connection is restored the data will be populated to the MongoDB database.
